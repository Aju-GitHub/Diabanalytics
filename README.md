# Diabanalytics
Diabanalytics is my new project. It is about analyzing whether a patient is diabetic or not using certain medical test metrices. This is usually done by measuring sugar levels (mg/dL), but using data and machine learning algorithms, we can predict a person could likely or not likely get diabetes in future.
