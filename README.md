# Diabanalytics
Diabanalytics is my new project. It is about analyzing whether a patient is diabetic or not using certain medical test metrices. This is usually done by measuring sugar levels (mg/dL), but using data and machine learning algorithms, we can predict a person could likely or not likely get diabetes in future. In Diabanalytics, i tried a new style by adding "User Inputs", where the user can give metrices like "Insulin" level , "Glucose" level. This idea is executed on the basis of correlation of values. Like, Glucose level deviation can make Insulin disruption, which is the main cause for diabetes (speaking about diabetes Mellitus).
I have uploaded a pdf version of the programme code (in python- jupyter), where you can understand the work flow.
I have the data set (csv file) uploaded with this, that could be utilized for testing, training ML algorithms.
